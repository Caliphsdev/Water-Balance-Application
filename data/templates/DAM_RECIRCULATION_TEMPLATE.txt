DAM RECIRCULATION CODES - INTERNAL CIRCULATION FLOWS
================================================================================
NOTE: These are INTERNAL flows that loop within or between structures.
These flows do NOT represent water entering or leaving the mine system.
They are tracked separately for water balance accounting purposes.

KEY CONCEPTS:
• Dam self-loops = water recirculating within the SAME dam structure
• Inter-dam transfers = water moving between dams in the same area
• These flows are important for tracking individual dam levels
• They do NOT count as area inflows/outflows (they cancel out)

================================================================================
📍 MER_NORTH - Merensky North Area
================================================================================

🔄 DAM SELF-LOOPS (Recirculation within same dam):
  MERN_NDCDG ↻ MERN_NDCDG             (dam_return  ) = 1 965 m³  # NDCD 3-4 & NDSWD 2 Group internal recirculation

  NOTES:
  • Water circulates within the dam structure itself
  • Common for pump recirculation, mixing, or return lines
  • Net effect on dam level depends on operational use

  NOTES:
  • Internal recirculation within MPSWD 1-2
  • May include pump circulation or water quality management

================================================================================
📍 MER_SOUTH - Merensky South Area
================================================================================

🔄 DAM SELF-LOOPS:
  MERS_MDCDG ↻ MERS_MDCDG             (dam_return  ) = 77 m³  # MDCD 5-6 dam return loop

  NOTES:
  • Internal recirculation within MDCD 5-6 Group
  • Operational flow for dam level management

================================================================================
📍 OLD_TSF - Old TSF Area
================================================================================

🔄 DAM SELF-LOOPS:
  OT_NEW_TSF ↻ OT_NEW_TSF             (dam_return  ) = 68 m³  # New TSF internal loop

  NOTES:
  • All flows are self-loops (water recirculating within the same dam)
  • Important for tracking individual dam operational patterns
  • Net effect on area water balance = ZERO

================================================================================
📍 STOCKPILE - Stockpile Area
================================================================================

🔄 DAM SELF-LOOPS:
  STP_SPCD1 ↻ STP_SPCD1               (dam_return  ) = 3 014 m³  # SPCD 1 dam return loop
  STP_STOCK ↻ STP_STOCK               (area_return ) = 484 m³  # Stockpile Area internal loop

🔄 BIDIRECTIONAL FLOWS:
  STP_SEPTIC ↔ STP_SPCD1              (effluent    ) = _____ m³  # Septic Tank ↔ SPCD 1

  NOTES:
  • SPCD 1 and Stockpile Area have internal recirculation

================================================================================
📍 UG2_NORTH - UG2 North Decline Area
================================================================================

🔄 DAM SELF-LOOPS:
  UG2N_NDCDG ↻ UG2N_NDCDG             (dam_return  ) = -26 m³  # NDCD 1-2 & NDSWD 1 Group dam return loop

  NOTES:
  • Internal recirculation within NDCD Group (NDCD 1-2 + NDSWD 1)
  • Operational pump circulation or mixing within the dam group

================================================================================
📍 UG2_PLANT - UG2 Plant Area
================================================================================

🔄 DAM SELF-LOOPS:
  UG2PCD1 ↻ UG2PCD1                   (dam_return  ) = 36 m³  # UG2PCD 1 internal loop

🔄 DAM ↔ PLANT BIDIRECTIONAL:
  UG2PCD1 ↔ UG2P_PLANT                (process_rtrn) = _____ m³  # Dam ↔ Plant water exchange
  
  BIDIRECTIONAL FLOW INTERPRETATION:
  • POSITIVE value = Net flow FROM dam TO plant (dam supplies plant)
  • NEGATIVE value = Net flow FROM plant TO dam (plant returns water)
  • ZERO = Balanced flows in both directions
  
  NOTES:
  • UG2PCD1 has internal recirculation loop
  • UG2PCD1 exchanges water with UG2 Plant (bidirectional)
  • Plant draws water from dam, returns dirty process water

  TYPICAL FLOW PATTERN:
  • High production: More water FROM dam TO plant (positive)
  • Low production: More water FROM plant TO dam (negative/return)

================================================================================
📍 UG2_SOUTH - UG2 South Decline Area
================================================================================

🔄 DAM SELF-LOOPS:

  NOTES:
  • Internal recirculation within MDCD 1-4 Group
  • Operational pump circulation or mixing

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES - INTERNAL CIRCULATION ACCOUNTING
================================================================================

✅ WHAT ARE INTERNAL RECIRCULATION FLOWS?
• Water moving between structures within the SAME area
• One structure loses water, another structure gains the same amount
• Net effect on area water balance = ZERO
• Important for tracking individual dam levels and flow patterns

⚠️  WHY TRACK SEPARATELY?
• Dam level predictions: Need to know which dams are gaining/losing water
• Operational planning: Understanding flow patterns for pump scheduling
• Water balance validation: Ensure internal flows match between source/destination
• Regulatory reporting: Some flows must be reported even if internal

🔄 BIDIRECTIONAL FLOWS EXPLAINED:
• Some flows can go either direction depending on operations
• Direction shown as "↔" (two-way arrow)
• Sign convention:
  - POSITIVE = Flow in the direction shown (FROM → TO)
  - NEGATIVE = Flow opposite to direction shown (TO → FROM)
  - ZERO = No net flow (balanced or no movement)

📊 WATER BALANCE TREATMENT:
• For AREA water balance: Internal flows cancel out (don't count as inflow/outflow)
• For DAM water balance: Internal flows DO count (affect individual dam levels)
• For MINE-WIDE balance: All internal flows cancel out

💡 OPERATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE:
• TSF Irrigation: Prevents dust, maintains safe dam freeboard
• Plant-Dam Exchange: Optimizes water usage, manages water quality
• Underground Return: Separate category (not internal circulation)

================================================================================
EXAMPLES OF WHAT IS NOT INTERNAL RECIRCULATION:
================================================================================

❌ NOT Internal Circulation (these are real inflows/outflows):
• Underground return (water sent back to mine workings)
• Inter-area transfers (water moving between different areas)
• Evaporation (water leaving the system)
• Consumption (water used and not returned)
• Seepage (water lost to ground)
• Spillage (water leaving dam over weir)

✅ IS Internal Circulation (these loop within area):
• Dam-to-Dam transfers (e.g., NT RWD → New TSF)
• Dam-to-Plant-to-Dam loops (e.g., UG2PCD1 ↔ Plant)
• Treatment-to-Dam returns within same area (e.g., STP → Dam)

================================================================================
VALIDATION CHECKS:
================================================================================

✔️  For each internal flow, verify:
1. Source structure exists in the same area as destination
2. Flow volume matches in both source's outflow and destination's inflow
3. Bidirectional flows have consistent sign convention
4. Net area water balance excludes these internal flows

✔️  Common issues to watch for:
• Double-counting internal flows in area totals
• Misclassifying inter-area transfers as internal circulation
• Forgetting to update both ends of a bidirectional flow
• Mixing up positive/negative signs on bidirectional flows
