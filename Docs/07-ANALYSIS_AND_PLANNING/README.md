## 📋 Planning Template

When planning a new phase or feature:

1. **Analysis Phase:**
   - Document scope and requirements
   - Identify constraints and dependencies
   - Create initial analysis summary

2. **Architecture Phase:**
   - Design system approach
   - Compare alternatives
   - Document decisions and rationale

3. **Implementation Phase:**
   - Create detailed checklist
   - Estimate effort
   - Assign tasks
   - Track progress

4. **Completion Phase:**
   - Summarize what was done
   - Document lessons learned
   - Identify improvements
   - Plan next steps

## ✅ Before Planning a Feature

Make sure you have:
- [ ] Read ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md for project overview
- [ ] Reviewed MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md for architectural context
- [ ] Understood IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md approach
- [ ] Identified feature scope and requirements
- [ ] Documented assumptions and dependencies

---

## 🚀 Feature Planning Workflow

1. **Initiate** (using ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md as reference)
2. **Design** (using MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md pattern)
3. **Implement** (tracking with IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md)
4. **Complete** (summarize like REBUILD_SUMMARY.md)

---

**Reading order:**
1. ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md (20-30 min)
2. MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md (30-45 min)
3. REBUILD_SUMMARY.md (20-30 min)
4. Reference IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md during development

**Total time:** 70-105 minutes
