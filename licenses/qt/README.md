Qt / PySide6 Licensing Bundle
============================

This folder is packaged with Water Balance Dashboard distributions to support
open-source license notice obligations for Qt for Python dependencies.

Included files:
- LGPL-3.0.txt
- GPL-3.0.txt
- GPL-2.0.txt
- Qt-Commercial-Notice*.txt

Notes:
- This product uses PySide6 under open-source licensing terms unless a separate
  commercial Qt license agreement applies.
- Qt Virtual Keyboard binaries/plugins are intentionally excluded from packaged
  builds to avoid accidental GPL-only module distribution.

- THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt at application root.
