# ✅ HELP DASHBOARD UPDATE - COMPLETE

**Date:** January 23, 2026  
**Status:** READY FOR PRODUCTION

---

## 📋 What Was Done

### 1. **Evaporation Documentation - COMPREHENSIVE** ✅

Added complete evaporation guidance throughout Help Dashboard:

**Storage Tab** (NEW SECTIONS):
- "Rainfall & Evaporation in Storage" - Complete formulas and configuration
- "Facility-Level Configuration" - How to enable/disable per facility
- "Seepage Losses" - Outflow and aquifer seepage explained

**Calculations Tab**:
- Enhanced evaporation loss explanation
- Specified: Source Pan Evaporation (Category A standard)
- Added configuration paths
- Explained capping mechanism

**Key Info Provided**:
```
❓ WHAT IS IT?
   → Source Pan Evaporation (standard Category A measurement)

❓ WHERE TO CONFIGURE?
   → Settings → Environmental Parameters → Regional Evaporation

❓ HOW DOES IT WORK?
   → Formula: (Evaporation mm / 1000) × Surface Area m² = Loss (m³)
   → Applied to all facilities with evap_active = 1
   → Capped at current facility volume

❓ ZONE?
   → 4A (default, configurable)

❓ UNITS?
   → mm/month (NOT mm/day)

❓ HOW TO TROUBLESHOOT?
   → New Troubleshooting section: "Evaporation values too high/low"
```
