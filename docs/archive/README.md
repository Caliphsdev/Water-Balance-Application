# Archived Documentation

This directory contains older status reports, implementation summaries, and temporary documentation that have been superseded by more current documentation or have served their purpose.

## Purpose

These documents are kept for:
- **Historical reference**: Understanding how features were implemented
- **Troubleshooting**: Finding solutions to past issues
- **Audit trail**: Tracking changes and decisions made
- **Legacy knowledge**: Information that may still be relevant in edge cases

## Using This Archive

### When to Reference This
- Looking for how a specific feature was originally implemented
- Understanding why certain decisions were made
- Finding edge cases or known issues that were solved
- Tracking historical changes

### When NOT to Use This
- **Don't follow outdated implementation guides** - Use current documentation in `docs/features/` instead
- **Don't execute archived scripts** - They may reference old code paths
- **Don't use as current reference** - Always check `docs/` first for current state

---

## Maintenance Notes

These files are read-only in practice. If you need to:
1. **Update current documentation**: Edit files in `docs/features/` instead
2. **Delete old files**: Only remove if absolutely certain they're not needed
3. **Reference archived work**: Consider consolidating into current docs if still relevant

## Finding Current Documentation

For current feature documentation, see:
- [`docs/features/`](../features/) - Active feature guides
- [`docs/`](../) - Main documentation files
- Project's main [`README.md`](../../README.md)
